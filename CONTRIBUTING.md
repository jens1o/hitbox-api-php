# Contributing

## General
First, please do a search in the issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed(this is especially important when you need to ask a question). Use this query to search for the most popular feature requests.

Use the template to make it easier for me to reproduce it or understand the way it works, this will resolve it faster than you need to fill out the template taking five minutes. :)

Whenever I don't respond for longer than a week, feel free to push it.
Please keep in mind that I can oversee some issues or prs or didn't got the time and moved and moved it and... I forgot it. :/

### Use reactions
If you find out that your issue/pull request already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction(so I can see whether it is important to the community). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" /"-1" comment.

## Before creating an issue
As I said, make sure that this issue doesn't exist, yet.

If you think you're having a bug, please provide a [SSCE](http://www.sscce.org/), which increases my motivation tremendously to help and fix your bug, because I don't need to ask and wait for responses, but I got something to work with. Please feel **fill out** the (reduced to the most important parts) **issue template**, which wants you to provide that information. ;)

## Before creating a pr
Please make sure there is an issue on that you're working with. If you want to implement something, where there isn't an issue, create one and wait for responses. Otherwise, you may work on something that I won't merge because it doesn't fit and you spent your (free-)time on something that "only" improved your knowledge.

Before you get your hands dirty with creating a pr, make a comment in the issue that you are working on it. If you need help, please do not hesitate to ask the other community members. :) You don't need to be the best, but you can do that like you want. :)

I especially look that your pr fits into the project vision, implements my basic code style(Don't mind, I can "fix" your code to fit my needs) and actually resolves the issue. Please do not base your pull request on the master branch, but instead on a new created one. Also, please make sure that you only fix one issue with one Pull Request.
