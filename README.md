### Preample
This is a php library making api requests to hitbox quite easy. It's designed to use models(like `HitboxUser`). It's using the composer autoloader, so if you want to init the library, here's how you go:
1. Download/Clone this repository
2. Execute `composer install` in your clone
3. In your script, add:
```php
<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// other code...
```
4. Use the lib.

The following chapter will teach you about the differents models this library offers at the moment. If you feel something is missing, feel free to create a pr. Also, if you want to improve the English(fix grammar and spelling mistakes) in this documentation, it would be quite nice!
