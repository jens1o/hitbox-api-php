# Contributing

## General
First, please do a search in the issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed(this is especially important when you need to ask a question). Use this query to search for the most popular feature requests.

Use the template to make it easier for me to reproduce it or understand the way it works, this will resolve it faster than you need to fill out taking five minutes. :)

Whenever I don't respond for longer than a week, feel free to push it.
Please keep in mind that I can oversee some issues or prs or didn't got the time and moved and moved it and... I forgot it. :/

### Use reactions
If you find out that your issue/pull request already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction(so I can see whether it is important to the community). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment.

👍 - upvote

👎 - downvote
